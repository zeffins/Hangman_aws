# Code Fixes and Explanations

## 1. Fixed Duplicate Condition in makeGuess
The `makeGuess` function had duplicate checks for game over and winner states. Removed the duplicate check.

## 2. Invalid Dependencies in GameNPC useEffect
The `useEffect` dependency array included mutable values that would cause infinite re-renders. Removed renderer, scene, camera from dependencies as they are created inside the effect.

## 3. Completed Hangman Component Return Statement
Added proper keyboard implementation and game status messages.

## 4. Code Organization
- Properly organized state management
- Added proper error handling
- Improved component structure
- Added cleanup for Three.js resources

## How to Test
1. Start the game and make sure the keyboard works
2. Test winning condition by guessing correct word
3. Test losing condition by making 6 wrong guesses
4. Verify that the hint system works
5. Check that the NPC mood changes correctly
6. Verify that the game can be reset properly
